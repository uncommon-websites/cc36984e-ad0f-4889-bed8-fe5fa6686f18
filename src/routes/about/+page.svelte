		"Donna was born out of frustration. As former operators and busy executives, our team found themselves in the same endless loop—status meetings that told us too little, dashboards that were always out of date, and email threads asking, ‘Where does this stand?’ We weren’t trying to micromanage. We just couldn’t see what was moving, what was stuck, or what deserved our attention. We needed a better way to stay informed—without disrupting our teams.",
		"The idea for Donna clicked during one particularly packed day of back-to-back updates. After hours of notes and calls, we realized: none of this should require so much chasing. Project data already lived across tools like Slack, Jira, Notion, and Google Calendar—we just weren’t seeing it from our seats. That’s when we asked: what if there were an AI Chief of Staff that could quietly connect the dots and surface exactly what an executive needs to know, every morning, in plain English?", 
		"From day one, we built Donna with the oversight, trust, and security our own teams would demand. That means zero data storage—nothing gets kept—and full SOC-2 compliance. Today, Donna is running in a limited pilot cohort for CEOs and executives who want real-time visibility without the baggage of traditional updates. White-glove onboarding included. No friction, just real clarity."
